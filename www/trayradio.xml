	<Changes>
		- Added ID3v1 tagging, easy to implement, but not sufficient due to string length limit to 30 characters. Future plan is ID3v2.
		- Added preferences button to HotKeyWindow.
		- HotKeyWindow update. Now contains functional controls such Play, Stop, Record, Mute and radio selection. You can now play all radios simultaneously at the moment (probably it will change in future).

		- Connected with Appveyor.
		- Removed unused NuGet packages.

		- Added own SearchDirectory function in case of UnauthorizedAccessException.
		- Show recording icons fix.
